# Movie Project
This project is a movie application that allows users to add, edit, and delete movies, as well as rate them. It features a user-friendly interface and integrates with OMDB API for movie posters. The app is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for a responsive user experience and uses fetch API and RESTful APIs to communicate with a server for storage of movie data.

## Prerequisites
- OMDB API key
- Glitch account with remixed version of the Movies Application

## Getting Started in a Few Simple Steps
1. Create a `keys.js` file in the `js` directory to store your api key.
2. Define your API key as a variable in the `keys.js` file:
- **const OMDB_API_KEY = `YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE`**
3. Remix the project to your own Glitch account using the following link:
- https://glitch.com/edit/#!/billowy-unmarred-coreopsis?path=README.md%3A1%3A0
- Use your own remixed URL to fetch results inside your project to perform RESTful API requests, it should look like: https://your-random-url.glitch.me/movies.
